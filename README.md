# Semantix

Semantix is a [Jena](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/ontology/)-based Java API for managing and querying [SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) thesauri. The API includes a **Semantic Web Service (SWS)** for delivering thesauri (stored in a Jena TDB triple store), and an **Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)** tool for loading content into the triple store.
